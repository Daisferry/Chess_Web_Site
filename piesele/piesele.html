                <b>The Pawn (worth 1 point)</b>
            </a>

            <a class="piece_text">
                The pawn is one of the most fundamental pieces, it can go 2 steps forward the first time it moves, and 1 step after that.
                It is also the only piece who can capture different from the way it moves, being able to capture diagonally 1 square away.
                It also has the unique ability to transform into any other piece (aside from the king) if it reaches the back rank of the enemy board.

                <b>The Knight (worth 3 points)</b>
            </a>

            <a class="piece_text">
                The knight is a unique piece with the ability to move in an 'L' shape: (2-up, 1-right), (2-up, 1-left), (2-down, 1-right), (2-down, 1-left).
                Due to it's weird moving, it's the only piece in the game able to move despite other pieces being in it's way, in other words, it is the only
                piece who can jump over others.

            </a>

            <a class="piece_text">
                The bishop is the "sniper" of chess, able to move diagonally however much it pleases, it is able to move between pieces and is
                able to provide support from a distance with it's high range and fast maneuverability.

                <b>The Rook (worth 5 points)</b>
            </a>

            <a class="piece_text">
                The rook is a powerful piece, it is able to move horizontally and vertically without limit. It is generally used to support pieces
                and block entire files from the back rank. It is potent enough to deliver checkamte by iteself (with the king) and is a very good
                secondary treath when combined with the queen.

                <b> The Queen (worth 9 points) </b>
            </a>

            <a class="piece_text">
                The queen is the most powerful piece on the board. Her movement patters are a combination of the Rook and Bishop.
                Due to her ability to move like 2 pieces at the same time, she is generally used as the frontline attacker, and is the most used
                when trying to checkmate the oponent.

            </a>

            <a class="piece_text">
                The king is the central piece of the game, the most important piece, and what determines who wins and who loses.
                He can move to any adjacent square (including diagonally) and is able to move with the rook (if the king & rook have not moved yet)
                to make something called "castling", puting the king behind the rook. When the king is under attack, and has nowhere to move, you have lost.
